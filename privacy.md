# CrashyBot — Privacy Policy  
Effective Date: 2025-11-28  

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy explains how CrashyBot (“the Bot”) handles data when used on Discord. The Bot is an entertainment utility that provides random Crash Bandicoot–related commands (such as characters, modes, and levels).  

By using the Bot, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Data Collection  

CrashyBot is designed to operate **without collecting or storing personal user data**.

The Bot does **NOT** collect or store:
- Real names  
- Email addresses  
- IP addresses  
- Messages outside the command itself  
- Private messages  
- Account credentials  
- Payment or financial information  
- Location data  

The only data that may be **temporarily processed in memory** (not saved to a database) includes:
- Discord User ID (to respond to the command requester)
- Discord Server (Guild) ID (to determine where the command was used)
- Discord Channel ID (to send the reply)

This data is used **only in real time for command execution** and is **not persisted**.

---

## 3. How Data Is Used  

Any temporarily processed technical data is used exclusively to:
- Execute the requested CrashyBot command
- Send the correct output to the correct Discord channel
- Prevent technical errors during runtime

CrashyBot does **not**:
- Track users
- Profile users
- Analyze behavior for marketing
- Use analytics platforms
- Perform external tracking

---

## 4. Data Storage  

CrashyBot does **not maintain a user database**.  
No long-term storage of user information, server information, or command history is performed.

If temporary logs are generated for debugging during development, they:
- Contain **no personal content**
- Are used only for fixing errors
- Are deleted after debugging is complete

---

## 5. Data Sharing  

CrashyBot:
- Does **not sell** data  
- Does **not share** data  
- Does **not transfer** data to third parties  
- Does **not integrate** with external data processors  

All command processing is internal to the bot’s runtime environment.

---

## 6. User Rights  

Because the Bot does not store user data persistently:
- There is no permanent data to request, export, or delete.
- If you have concerns about temporary debugging logs, you may contact the developer and request confirmation of deletion.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy  

CrashyBot does not knowingly collect data from children.  
Use of the Bot is restricted by Discord’s own minimum age requirements.  

By using the Bot, you confirm that you meet Discord’s age requirements.

---

## 8. Policy Changes  

This Privacy Policy may be updated if CrashyBot gains new features involving:
- User accounts
- Databases
- Dashboards
- External APIs
- Logging systems

When updates occur, the Effective Date will be revised. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 9. Contact
